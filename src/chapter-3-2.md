Seeking Feedback

Seeking feedback from colleagues, supervisors, or mentors can provide valuable insights into areas where improvement is needed. Here are some strategies for seeking feedback:

### Ask for Specific Feedback

Asking for specific feedback on areas such as communication, leadership, or problem-solving skills can help individuals identify potential triggers and warning signs.

### Be Open to Criticism

Being open to criticism and willing to make changes based on feedback can help individuals improve their performance and prevent future conflicts.

Recognizing physical and emotional reactions to difficult workplace situations can also help individuals identify triggers and warning signs. Here are some strategies for recognizing physical and emotional reactions:

### Pay Attention to Physical Symptoms

Paying attention to physical symptoms like headaches, muscle tension, or fatigue can help individuals recognize signs of stress and potential triggers.
